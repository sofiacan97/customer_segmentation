#  Customer Segmentation

## Overview:
This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using machine learning techniques. By identifying different customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service to better meet the needs of each segment.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sofiacan97/customer_segmentation.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize the features if necessary.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identify relevant features for customer segmentation.
3. **Model Training:** Apply machine learning algorithms such as K-means clustering or KMedoids clustering to segment the customers.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the quality of the clustering results using metrics like silhouette score or inertia.
5. **Interpretation:** Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment and derive actionable insights for business decisions.
